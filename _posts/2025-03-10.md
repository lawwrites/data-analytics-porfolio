# title: "From Hollywood headlines to data binges."
### date: 2025-03-10


<p>My love affair with media research kicked off during my internship at Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, where I discovered the magic of turning data into compelling stories. Digging into TV and film audience trends, streaming insights, and entertainment market analytics wasn’t just fascinating—it became my passion and launched my journey into media analytics.</p>
<p>Currently, as a Media Coordinator for Editorial Post Production Operations at Paramount Global, I'm immersed daily in the exciting challenge of translating shoot and media data into actionable insights for beloved shows like the “BET Awards” and “RuPaul’s Drag Race: Whatcha Packin’.” My role thrives on collaboration, whether it's implementing workflow solutions with Asana and Airtable, or creating detailed reports to pinpoint and streamline inefficiencies across cross-functional teams.</p>
<p>While I have an MFA in Film and TV Production from University of Southern California, to sharpen my analytical toolkit, I've earned Udacity’s Data Analysis Nanodegree and am now pursuing my M.S. in Data Analytics at WGU. This blog is where I'll showcase my adventures in data, like exploring gender equality metrics around the globe or dissecting media coverage of political heavyweights during election cycles.
I invite you to join me as I transform data into actionable insights—because great stories, especially in entertainment, always begin with the right numbers.</p>
